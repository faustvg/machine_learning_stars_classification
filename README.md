# Star Dataset for Stellar Classification
## Author: Faustino Vazquez Gabino
## Professor: Prof. Dr. Felix Voigtlaender

# Introduction
This project focuses on classifying stars as dwarfs or giants using machine learning techniques. By analyzing various stellar attributes, we aim to improve our understanding of stellar properties and demonstrate the effectiveness of machine learning.

# Goals
Classification: How well can a model distinguish between Giant and Dwarf stars?
Feature Importance: Which attributes are most critical in this classification?

# Project Structure
Exploratory Data.
Data Preparation
Machine Leearning Models (Classification Models)
