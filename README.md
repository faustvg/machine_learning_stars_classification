# Introduction
This project focuses on classifying stars as dwarfs or giants using machine learning techniques. By analyzing various stellar attributes, we aim to improve our understanding of stellar properties and demonstrate the effectiveness of machine learning.

# Goals

  Classification: How well can a model distinguish between Giant and Dwarf stars?
  Feature Importance: Which attributes are most critical in this classification?

# Techniques Used

  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Both univariate and multivariate analysis were conducted to understand the data.
  Feature Engineering: Techniques such as standardization and SelectKBest were applied to optimize the feature set.
  Model Selection: Grid Search,Paramater Grid and Pipeline were utilized to identify the best-performing models.
  Cross-Validation: Employed to ensure the robustness and reliability of the models.
